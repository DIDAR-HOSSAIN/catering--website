        <h1>My Recipies</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Today, many people are interested in adding a number of skills to their resumes, and recipe writing may be a valuable one. Whether you’re a blogger, book author, newsletter editor, foodservice director, or community nutritionist, there are many reasons why becoming a good recipe writer can further your success. “Writing recipes that are clear, easy to follow, tailored to a specific audience, and well tested and work as promised really matters. Bringing them to life visually is the icing on the cake,” says Liz Weiss, MS, RD, book author, blogger, and recipe developer.</p>

                    The rules for recipe writing are pretty intuitive and straightforward. Yet, if you don’t practice them, you can leave a cook confused, hopeless, and with a batch of inedible food. Likely, you’ve tried to follow a poorly written recipe, and you know just how frustrating it can be. Try my steps for recipes worthy of a best-selling cookbook author.
